This is the readme file. You can use a text editor to edit it. Also, don't forget to get the Windows app for GitHub! It makes things so much easier. -DS, the github anon

(alternatively, you can also use the site to edit the repo for your site. it comes with a built in txt editor for all needs, and a console that points out conflicting items in your code! :] it is recommended to use the app however, as you can add folders and crap like that)



So im thinking that maybe..
have a main page
       For the main page, instead of making 500+ individual pages, maybe just write a script that will:
            keep track of pg num
            when pg # increments, change the image to the coresponding page

index page
about page
+whatever else


Thoughts?
