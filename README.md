This is the readme file. You can use a text editor to edit it. Also, don't forget to get the Windows app for GitHub! It makes things so much easier. -DS, the github anon

(alternatively, you can also use the site to edit the repo for your site. it comes with a built in txt editor for all needs, and a console that points out conflicting items in your code! :] )
